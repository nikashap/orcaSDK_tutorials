# orcaSDK_tutorials
NOTE: Read ftdi_orca_setup_guide.md for instructions on how to setup ORCA with MacOS
## Introduction

This repo contains a set of small code examples and tutorials for illustrating how to interact with your Orca series motor through our [C++](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orcaSDK/) or [Python](https://pypi.org/project/pyorcasdk/0.2.0/) SDK. This repo contains tutorials for common use cases for using our motors via the SDK. 

## Building the SDK

If you have not downloaded and built the SDK yet, navigate to [our Github repo for the SDK](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orcaSDK) and follow the setup instructions in the README.

### If using pyorcasdk

If you're using the python bindings version of the library, only read the section [Setting Up Hardware and Testing Your Motor](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orcaSDK?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-hardware-and-testing-your-motor).

## How to Use the Tutorials

In order to build and use the code examples, use the same steps found in the orcaSDK's README in the section [Building Your Application](https://github.com/IrisDynamics/orcaSDK/#compile-and-run-your-application). In this case, each of the tutorials are an executable target contained in a larger project. Thus to use any of them, build your project with the [./Tutorials/CMakeLists.txt](./Tutorials/CMakeLists.txt) file as the root file. Don't forget, if you chose to build but not install the SDK, you will need to update the find_package(orcaSDK) command in the CMakeLists.txt file with a PATHS argument that points to the SDK's build directory.

These tutorials may rely on each other for prior knowledge. If a tutorial is dependent on having completed another tutorial first, it will provide a link to it under a "Prerequisites" header. Because of this, you can navigate the tutorials in any order you wish. A single exception to this is every tutorial will have expected you to complete [Tutorial 01: HelloWorld and ReadPosition](./Tutorials/01_HelloWorld_ReadPosition/HelloWorld_ReadPosition.md). Because of this, Tutorial 01 will never be included in the Prerequisites section of another tutorial, because it is an implicit prerequisite.

### If using pyorcasdk

If you're using the python bindings version of this library then this tutorial suite is still applicable to you. The structure of a program which interacts with either orcaSDK or pyorcasdk is equivalent. Because of this, we recommend still reading the writeups for each tutorial. As you read a tutorial, in that tutorial's folder there is a python source file, main.py, which contains the Python equivalents of the final result. Please refer to that file if the C++ code blocks are too confusing.

If you've followed the instructions up until now, you're ready to begin coding! Walk through [the first tutorial](./Tutorials/01_HelloWorld_ReadPosition/HelloWorld_ReadPosition.md) to learn about the most basic application that uses our SDK.
